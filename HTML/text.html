<!-- Headings
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
	
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections 
under the subheadings then the 
<h3> element is used, and so 
on...

Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p> 
tag and closing </p> tag.

By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.

Bold & Italic
<b>
By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold.

<i>
By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic.

Superscript & Subscript
E.g
<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn 
about E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere 
grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<sup>
The <sup> element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power such 
as 22.
<sub>
The <sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H2
O

White Space

<p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>
 <p>The moon     is drifting away from Earth.</p>
 <p>The moon is drifting away from Earth.</p>

 In all cases there is only one space given

 When the browser comes across 
two or more spaces next to each 
other, it only displays one space. 
Similarly if it comes across a line 
break, it treats that as a single 
space too. This is known as 
white space collapsing. 

Can be taken advantage of and can indent the code for better readability.

Line Break & Horizontal Rules

 <br />
If you wanted 
to add a line break inside the 
middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag <br />.

<p>The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier 
 every day<br />due to falling space dust.</p>

<hr />
To create a break between 
themes — such as a change of 
topic in a book or a new scene 
in a play — you can add a 
horizontal rule between sections 
using the <hr /> tag.

<p>Venus is the only planet that rotates 
 clockwise.</p>
 <hr />
 <p>Jupiter is bigger than all the other planets 
 combined.</p>

Semantic Markup
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages — they are known as semantic markup.

<strong>
The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in this area.</p>
<p>This toy has many small pieces and is <strong>not 
 suitable for children under five years old.
 </strong></p>

 <em>
The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show 
the contents of an <em> element in italic.

<p>I <em>think</em> Ivy was the first.</p>
<p>I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first.</p>
<p>I think Ivy was the <em>first</em>.</p>

Quotations

<blockquote>
The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the <p> element is still used inside the <blockquote> element. 

Browsers indent the text inside <blockquote>
but DONT USE this to intend use CSS instead

 <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
 Winnie-the-Pooh">
 <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start 
 again?</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to 
 animals. Not many listen though. That's the 
 problem.</q></p>

 <q>
The <q> element is used for 
shorter quotes that sit within 
a paragraph.

Abbreviations and Acronyms

<abbr>
If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr>element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

 <p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen 
 Hawking is a theoretical physicist and 
 cosmologist.</p>
 <p><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space 
 Administration">NASA</acronym> do some crazy 
 space stuff.</p>

 If you hover on the abbrevation it should show the full form entered in the title attribute.

 Citations & Definitions

<cite>
When you are referencing a 
piece of work such as a book, 
film or research paper, the  <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.

 <p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>

Browsers will render the content of a <cite> element in italics

<dfn>
The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.

Some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in 
italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.

Author details

<address>
The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page

 <address>
 <p><a href="mailto:homer@example.org">
 homer@example.org</a></p>
 <p>742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield.</p>
 </address>

Browsers often display the content of the <address> 
element in italics.

 <ins>
 <del>
The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.The content of a <ins> element is usually underlined, while the 
content of a <del> element usually has a line through it.

<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea 
 she had ever had.</p>

<s>
The <s> element indicates something that is no longer 
accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
Visually the content of an <s> element will usually be displayed with a line through the center. 

<p>Laptop computer:</p>
 <p><s>Was $995</s></p>
 <p>Now only $375</p>  



Example:

  <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about 
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies 
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all 
    the other scientific journals her work had 
    appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On 
    The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book 
    since college, and the longer she spent in these 
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be 
    free.</p>
  <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, 
    sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote 
    proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of 
    people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although 
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling 
    the secrets of the llama <abbr 
    title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an 
    outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think 
    she had something better to do.</p>
