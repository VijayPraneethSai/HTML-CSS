 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
 you follow the structure of what is being written. 
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

 </html>

  <!-- The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
  The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.
  Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
  Here is another paragraph between opening <p> and closing </p> tags. -->

  <!-- Attributes
  e.g. <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
  
  The attribute name indicates 
what kind of extra information 
you are supplying about the 
element's content. It should be 
written in lowercase.

 The value is the information 
or setting for the attribute. It 
should be placed in double 
quotes. Different attributes can 
have different values.

Here an attribute called lang is 
used to indicate the language 
used in this element. The value 
of this attribute on this page 
specifies it is in US English. -->

<!-- The HyperText part 
refers to the fact that HTML 
allows you to create links that 
allow visitors to move from one 
page to another quickly and 
easily. A markup language allows 
you to annotate text, and these 
annotations provide additional 
meaning to the contents of a 
document. If you think of a web 
page, we add code around the 
original text we want to display 
and the browser then uses 
the code to display the page 
correctly. So the tags we add are 
the markup. -->
