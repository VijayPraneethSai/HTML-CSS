Form Structure
<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" 
method="get">
 <p>This is where the form controls will appear.
 </p>
 </form>

Action
Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value 
is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the 
information in the form when it is submitted.

method
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
 
1.short forms (such as search boxes)
2.when you are just retrieving data from the web server 
(not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database)
 

With the post method the values are sent in what are 
known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the 
post method if your form:
1. allows users to upload a file
2. is very long
3. contains sensitive data       
   (e.g. passwords)
4. adds information to, or deletes information from, a database

Text Input

<input>
<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
 <p>Username:
 <input type="text" name="username" size="15" 
maxlength="30" />
 </p>
 </form>

name attribute
When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. 
(For example, in a login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and what has been given as the password.)

maxlength attribute
You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number 
of characters a user may enter into the text field. Its value is the number of characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the maxlength attribute could have a value of 4.

size attribute
The size attribute should not be used on new forms. It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the text input (measured by the number of characters that would be seen). 
For example, a value of 3 would create a box wide enough to display three characters (although a user could enter 
more characters if they desired).
In any new forms you write, CSS should be used to control 
the width of form elements. 


Password Input

<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
 <p>Username:
 <input type="text" name="username" size="15" 
maxlength="30" />
 </p>
 <p>Password:
 <input type="password" name="password" size="15" 
maxlength="30" />
 </p>
 </form>

Although the password is hidden on the screen, this does not mean that the data in a password control is sent securely to the server. You should never use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.
For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate with users' browsers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

Text Area

<form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
 <p>What did you think of this gig?</p>
 <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter 
your comments...</textarea>
 </form>

 used to take multi-line input from the user.

 Radio Button (Options)

<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
 <p>Please select your favorite genre:
 <br />
 <input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" 
checked="checked" /> Rock
 <input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" /> 
Pop
 <input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" /> 
Jazz
 </p>
 </form>

value attribute
The value attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option. 
The value of each of the buttons in a group should be different (so that the server knows which option the user has selected).

checked
The checked attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads.

Please note: Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a different option. If you are only allowing the user one 
option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to terms and conditions), you should use a checkbox instead.

Checkbox

 <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
 <p>Please select your favorite music service(s):
 <br />
 <input type="checkbox" name="service" 
value="itunes" checked="checked" /> iTunes
 <input type="checkbox" name="service" 
value="lastfm" /> Last.fm
 <input type="checkbox" name="service" 
value="spotify" /> Spotify
 </p>
 </form>

Drop Down List Box

<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
 <p>What device do you listen to music on?</p>
 <select name="devices">
    <option value="ipod">iPod</option>
    <option value="radio">Radio</option>
    <option value="computer">Computer</option>
  </select>
 </form>

selected
The selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute should be selected.

Radio and Drop Down list are similar, use the following thumb rule to decide which to use

 1. If users need to see all options at a glance, radio buttons arebetter suited.
 2. If there is a very long list of options (such as a list of countries), drop down list boxes work better.

 Mulitple Select Box

 <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
 <p>Do you play any of the following instruments? 
(You can select more than one option by holding 
down control on a PC or command key on a Mac 
while selecting different options.)</p>
 <select name="instruments" size="3" 
multiple="multiple">
 <option value="guitar" selected="selected">
 Guitar</option>
 <option value="drums">Drums</option>
 <option value="keyboard" 
selected="selected">Keyboard</option>
 <option value="bass">Bass</option>
 </select>
 </form>

size
You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the size attribute. Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. In the example you can see that three 
of the four options are shown.

multiple
You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by adding the multiple attribute with a value of multiple.

File Input Box

<form action="http://www.example.com/upload.php"
 method="post">
<p>Upload your song in MP3 format:</p>
<input type="file" name="user-song" /><br />
<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>

type="file"
This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a browse button. 
When the user clicks on the browse button, a window opens up that allows them to select a file from their computer to be uploaded to the website.

When you are allowing users to upload files, the method 
attribute on the <form> element must have a value of post. (You cannot send files using the HTTP get method.)

Submit Button
 <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php">
 <p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
 <input type="text" name="email" />
 <input type="submit" name="subscribe" 
 value="Subscribe" />
 </form>

Image Button
 <form action="http://www.example.org/subscribe.php">
 <p>Subscribe to our email list:</p> 
  <input type="text" name="email" />
  <input type="image" src="images/subscribe.jpg" 
width="100" height="20" />
 </form>

 <input>
type="image"
If you want to use an image for the submit button, you can give the type attribute a value of image. The src, width, height, and alt attributes work just like they do when used with the <img> element.

<input>
type="hidden"
This example also shows a hidden form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the View Source option 
in the browser). They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see. For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.
