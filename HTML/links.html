<!-- Writing Links

 <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

 When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.

AbsoLute urLs
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL

An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the 
homepage.

Linking to other Pages on the same site

When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a 
relative URL.
If all the pages of the site are in 
the same folder, then the value 
of the href attribute is just the 
name of the file.
If you have different pages of a 
site in different folders, then you 
can use a slightly more complex 
syntax.

<p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
 <li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>
 <li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
 <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
 </ul>
 </p>

Relative urLs
When linking to other pages within the same site, you can 
use relative URLs.
