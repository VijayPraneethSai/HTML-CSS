<!-- Ordered lists
are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

Unordered lists
are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

Definition lists
are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms


Ordered Lists
 <ol>
The ordered list is created with 
the <ol> element.

 <li>
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li 
stands for list item.

 Browsers indent lists by default

 <ol>
 <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
 <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
  minutes until tender</li>
 <li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
 <li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
 <li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
 </ol>

 Unordered Lists

 <ul>
The unordered list is created 
with the <ul> element.
 <li>
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li 
stands for list item.)

 <ul>
 <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
 <li>100ml milk</li>
 <li>50g salted butter</li>
 <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
 <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
 </ul>

 Definition Lists


<dl>
The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will 
usually see pairs of <dt> and 
<dd> elements.

<dt>
This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

<dd>
This is used to contain the definition.
Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term

Nested Lists

You can put a second list inside an <li> element tocreate a sub list or nested list. Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.

 <ul>
 <li>Mousses</li>
 <li>Pastries
 <ul>
 <li>Croissant</li>
 <li>Mille-feuille</li>
 <li>Palmier</li>
 <li>Profiterole</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Tarts</li>
 </ul>

   <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
   <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of

     you are making an omelette)</li>
