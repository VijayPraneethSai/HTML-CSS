<!-- Storing images on your site

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses

On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the images folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, product photographs might sit in a page called products, and images related to news might live in a folder called news.

Adding Images

<img>

<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />

It must carry the 
following two attributes:

src
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

alt
This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

title
You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this 
attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

alt text should be used so that users with visual impairments can understand what the image is.

If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (it and has no meaning) still the alt attribute should be used but the quotes should be left empty.

Height & Width of Images
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />

but we should use CSS more commonly.

Where to place images in your code 
1: Before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.

2: Inside the start of a paragraph
The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3: In the mIddle of a paragraph
The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in

Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements 
in one of two ways:

Block elements always appear on a new line. Examples of block elements include the <h1> and <p> elements.

If the <img> is followed by a block level element (such as  a paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line after the image.

Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line. Examples of inline elements include the <b>, <em>, and <img> elements.

If the <img> element is inside a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image.

HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption

<figure>
Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced 
a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 
You can have more than one image inside the <figure> 
element as long as they all share the same caption.
 
<figcaption>
The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order 
to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
Before these elements were created there was no way to 
associate an <img> element with its caption.

<figure>
 <img src="images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of 
 two sea otters floating in water">
 <br />
  <figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they 
 sleep so they don't drift away from each 
 other.</figcaption>
 </figure>

 Example:
 
 <html>
 <head>
  <title>Images</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>
   <img src="images/logo.gif"
      alt="From A to Zucchini" />
  </h1>
  <figure>
   <img src="images/chocolate-islands.jpg" 
      alt="Chocolate Islands"
      title="Chocolate Islands Individual Cakes" />
   <p>
    <figcaption>
     This recipe for individual chocolate 
     cakes is so simple and so delectable!
    </figcaption>
   </p>
  </figure>
