 <video>
 The <video> element has a 
number of attributes which allow 
you to control video playback:
 
 src
 This attribute specifies the path 
to the video. (The example video 
is in H264 format so it will only 
work in IE and Safari.)
 
 poster
 This attribute allows you to 
specify an image to show while 
the video is downloading or until 
the user tells the video to play.
 
 width,height
 These attributes specify the size 
of the player in pixels.
 
 controls
 When used, this attribute 
indicates that the browser 
should supply its own controls 
for playback.
 
 autoplay
 When used, this attribute 
specifies that the file should play 
automatically.
 
 loop
 When used, this attribute 
indicates that the video should 
start playing again once it has 
ended

preload
This attribute tells the browser 
what to do when the page 
loads. It can have one of three 
values: 

none
 The browser should not load 
the video until the user presses 
play.

auto
 The browser should download 
the video when the page loads.

metadata
 The browser should just collect 
information such as the size, 
first frame, track list, and 
duration.
